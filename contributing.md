# Contributing
Welcome! We'd love to have your input. Here are some basic guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Everything is on GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Issues
Before filing an issue, please check to see if one already exists.

When filing a new issue, use the appropriate Bug or Feature Request issue template and fill out all relevant fields.

## Non-Code Contributions
We look forward to working with the FFXIV theorycrafting community.
However, at this time we're not accepting submissions or suggestions for additional job sims.
We will announce when this is available -- please stay tuned for future updates!

## Code Contributions and Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. All code changes are subject to the PR process.

All pull requests must address an existing GitHub issue. Do not work on things under the "Future Plans" milestone -- we're not ready for those yet!
If you would like to contribute code, assign an issue to yourself. Nobody likes duplicating work!
If a relevant issue does not exist, file one and discuss it with the team before beginning your implementation -- pull requests without linked issues may be closed without approval. 
Make sure your change is likely to be approved before spending time and energy on it!

Check out our pull request template for the full requirements.

### Pull Request Reviews
All pull requests must be approved by the code owner before being merged to `main`. 
An additional person may be delegated to review your code prior to this.

### Minor Changes
In order to keep a manageable volume of pull requests, we only accept pull requests addressing minor changes (documentation fixes, typo fixes, small cosmetic tweaks, etc.) from existing contributors.

If you are new to this project and would like a minor issue addressed, please file a GitHub issue and we'll handle it. Thanks!

## Coding Style
* Use a coding style consistent with the existing codebase, as defined by the linter.
* Types must be annotated and code must pass `mypy` checks.
* Use spaces, not tabs for indentation.
* Function, variable, and module names (etc.) must be descriptive and informative.
* All code must be documented and tested.

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful of other people. Don't be a jerk.

## Any contributions you make will be under the AGPL software license
In short, when you submit code changes, you agree that your submission is under the same license that covers the project.
